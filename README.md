**Subject**: Big Data Management<br>
**Assignment**: Billboard selection<br>
**Research Paper Used**:<br>
*Zhang, P., Bao, Z., Li, Y., Li, G., Zhang, Y. and Peng, Z., 2018, July. Trajectory-driven influential billboard placement. In Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining (pp. 2748-2757).*<br><br>

**Operation**
1. Use src/generator/BillboardGenerator.java and ClusterGenerator.java to generate new billboards and clusters for the program.
2. Run src/Main.java
3. Check results in src/result  
(Note: the results are different from the answer folder as billboard data were generated randomly)<br><br>

**Implementation**  
The three algorithms are in src/algorithm<br><br>

**Notes**  
The program can produce accurate result.<br>
However the efficiency is not optimal.<br>
The repo is made public for improvements.
